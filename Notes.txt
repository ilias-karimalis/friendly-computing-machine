After discussing with Reto, I'm going to refactor the model transitions such 
that they all take a ProtectionDomain as an argument which is the domain that
is performing this transition in model state.

Rewriting the model initialize transition to insert a set of initial physical 
resource spaces and the initial ProtectionDomain { 0 }. Also making a change to
the invariants for ResourceSpaces, such that Virtual ResourcesSpaces are the 
only ones that need to be backed by a Map.
